Description: provides a common interface to Ansible from other platforms
 This tool and python library helps interface with Ansible directly,
 or as part of another system whether via a container image interface,
 as a standalone tool, or as a Python module that can be imported.
 This allows Ansible to be embedded into other systems that donâ€™t want
 to manage the complexities of the interface on their own.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
